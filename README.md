# UEFI based Bootable Space Invaders game

Still in development.

The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ) bootloader code I have written from scratch.  

Original 2.9 Specs PDF

The drive.hdd file boots in both QEMU and in VirtualBox.

MinGWx64 ( GCC )

OSFMount

**NOTE :** I have now included BAT files with the command line switches to use OSFMount without the GUI interface.  

Animated sprites already working. (UPDATE : This is going to be rewritten.)  

**TODO** : Game Logic, better Timer, Ship firing and movement.  

**Progress so far**
